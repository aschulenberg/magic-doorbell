# Magic Doorbell
Slaps a large notification on your screen when someone presses the doorbell (requires Raspberry Pi)

Since we can't just jaunch our coworkers into space this will have to do for now.

### Has one of these things happened to you
<ul> 1. You 're jamming with headphones on and somone is trying to get your attention</ul>
<ul> 2. You have entered the ultra instinct zone mode at work and a coworker trying to ask you something</ul>
<ul> 3. You are hiding in the back and nobody can find you </ul>
<ul> 4. You have a weak heart and might die if someone come up on you</ul>



### Other Ideas

Send notification to a smart watch

Swap button with a motion sensor (this would probably just be annoying)
